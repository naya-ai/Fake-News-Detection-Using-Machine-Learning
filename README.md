# Benchmarking Modeling Techniques for Highly Coiled Hair in Computer Graphics

## Project Overview

### What Am I Doing?

This project focuses on **assessing and benchmarking existing modeling techniques for simulating highly coiled hair** (Type 4 hair) in computer graphics. The aim is to evaluate these methods based on various criteria and provide insights and recommendations from my perspective to enhance representation and diversity in digital media.

### How Am I Doing It?

The project will follow a structured approach, which includes:

1. **Literature Review**: Studying existing research papers and articles on modeling highly coiled hair.
2. **Defining Benchmarking Criteria**: Establishing the parameters for evaluating different techniques.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Assessing each modeling method based on the defined criteria without recreating hair models.
4. **Results and Discussion**: Analyzing findings and incorporating my opinions on the effectiveness of each method.
5. **Recommendations**: Providing suggestions for best practices and potential improvements based on the assessment.

### Why Am I Doing It?

Highly coiled hair has been historically underrepresented and often inaccurately portrayed in computer graphics. By benchmarking existing modeling techniques and offering my insights, this project aims to:

- **Highlight the strengths and weaknesses** of current methods.
- **Contribute to discussions** on improving cultural accuracy in digital media.
- **Promote diversity and inclusivity** by advocating for better representation of Black hairstyles.
